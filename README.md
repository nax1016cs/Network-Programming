Homework in Network Programming.
It's about the homework in this course, I implemented a simple BBS server in TCP connection. On the server, the users can create accounts and create posts, comment the posts, subscribe in certain authors or subjects, etc. It mainly uses TCP connection and sqlite to store messages. As for the posts content, they are stored on AWS EC2.
